# ✨ Disarium Number Checker

A **Disarium Number** is a number in which the **sum of its digits powered by their positions** equals the number itself.

Example:
135 → 1¹ + 3² + 5³ = 135 ✔️  
89  → 8¹ + 9² = 89 ✔️  

This is a very common **coding round question** because it tests:
- Digit extraction
- Position-based power calculation
- Loops and indexing logic

---

## 🔹 Features
- Checks if a number is Disarium
- Uses digit-by-digit power calculation
- Clean and interview-ready program

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- `enumerate()` with positions
- Power operator `**`
- Loops & condition checks
- Strings and integers mixed logic

---

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python disarium_number_checker.py# Disarium_number
